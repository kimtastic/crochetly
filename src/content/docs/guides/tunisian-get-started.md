Tunisian crochet, also known as Afghan crochet, combines elements of knitting and crochet. It creates a dense, textured fabric using a special long hook called a Tunisian hook or Afghan hook. This guide will help you get started with the basics.

## What you need to get started

- **Tunisian Crochet Hook:** Longer than a regular hook to hold multiple loops.
- **Yarn:** Start with a smooth, medium-weight yarn (worsted weight #4 is ideal).
- **Tapestry Needle**: For weaving in ends.
- **Stitch Markers**: Help mark places in your work and to keep track of rounds.
- **Scissors**

## How Tunisian crochet works

Tunisian crochet is worked in rows without turning the work. There are two passes for each row:

- **Forward Pass:** Insert hook into stitches, yarn over, and pull up loops onto the hook (similar to knitting).
- **Return Pass:** Yarn over and pull through loops on the hook to work off the stitches. 

You keep loops on the hook during the forward pass, creating a row of loops before working them off on the return pass.

## Learning Tunisian crochet
 
 There are 4 common Tunisian crochet stitches.
 - **Tunisian Simple Stitch (TSS):** Basic stitch used for most projects.
- **Tunisian Knit Stitch (TKS):** Creates a knitted look.
- **Tunisian Purl Stitch (TPS):** Adds texture on the fabricâ€™s wrong side.
- **Tunisian Double Crochet (TDC):** Taller stitch for more drape.

If you are new to Tunisian crochet, there are many [YouTube crochet tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=crochet+tutorials) that provide clear, helpful guidance for Tunisian crochet stitches.

## Tips for Beginners

- Keep an even tension to avoid tight or loose stitches.
- Use a longer hook than usual to comfortably hold all loops.
- Use a larger hook to reduce curl and avoid overly tight tension.  
- Practice the Tunisian Simple Stitch `TSS` before moving to advanced stitches.
- Watch video tutorials to see the technique in action.

## Sample swatch pattern `TSS`

```plaintext
1. Chain 15.
2. Forward pass: Insert hook in 2nd `ch` from hook, yarn over, pull up loop across (14 loops on hook).
3. Return pass: Yarn over, pull through one loop, then yarn over pull through two loops across.
4. Repeat forward and return passes for 10 rows.
