Amigurumi is the Japanese art of knitting or crocheting small, stuffed yarn creatures. Itâ€™s a fun and creative hobby that anyone can learn! This guide will walk you through the basics to get you started.

## What you need to get started

- **Yarn**: Choose a smooth, medium-weight yarn (like worsted weight) in your favorite colors.
- **Crochet Hook**: Usually size 2.5mm to 4mm works well for amigurumi.
- **Stuffing**: Polyester fiberfill is commonly used.
- **Tapestry Needle**: For sewing pieces together and weaving in ends.
- **Stitch Markers**: To keep track of rounds.
- **Scissors**

## Basic terminology

Before you start, you should be familiar with these stitches:

- **Magic Ring (Magic Circle)**
- **Chain `ch`**
- **Single Crochet `sc`**
- **Increase `inc`**: 2 `sc` in one stitch
- **Decrease `dec`**: `sc` two stitches together

## Beginner Amigurumi project outline

**Start with a Magic Ring**  
Create a magic ring and crochet 6 single crochets into it. This will be the base of your piece.

**Increase rounds**  
Increase stitches evenly to form a flat circle. For example, round 2: 2 `sc` in each stitch (12 stitches total).

**Work even rounds**  
Crochet one `sc` in each stitch around without increasing to build the height.

**Decrease rounds**  
Start decreasing stitches evenly to close the shape.

**Stuff your amigurumi**  
Before closing completely, stuff your toy firmly with fiberfill.

**Close and finish**  
Use a tapestry needle to weave the yarn tail through the final stitches and pull tight. Weave in all loose ends.
