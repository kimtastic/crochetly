title: Gauge and tension
description: A guide to gauge and tension
---
Gauge refers to the number of stitches and rows you make per inch or 4 inches, usually measured in a swatch. Tension is the term more commonly used in the UK. 

Gauge is a crucial measurement because it affects the size and fit of your finished project. Making a swatch, checking it, and adjusting before starting your project can save time, yarn, and frustration.

- **Stitch gauge** = number of stitches across a set width (usually 4 inches / 10 cm)
- **Row gauge** = number of rows down a set length (usually 4 inches / 10 cm)


## Why is gauge important?

- Ensures your finished item matches the pattern dimensions.
- Avoids projects that are too small or too big.
- Helps with consistency when using different yarns or hooks.
- Critical for garments, toys (amigurumi), and fitted items.


## How to check your gauge

1. Use the yarn and hook recommended in the pattern.
2. Crochet a sample swatch, usually about 4"x4" (10x10 cm).
3. Lay your swatch flat (don't stretch).
4. Measure stitches and rows within the 4" square.
5. Adjust hook size if your gauge is off:
   - Too many stitches = use larger hook.
   - Too few stitches = use smaller hook.


## Tips for consistent tension

- Hold your yarn comfortably — not too tight or loose.
- Practice stitches evenly.
- Use the same hook type and size throughout.
- Avoid changing tension mid-project.
- Wash and block your swatch to see true size.

| Yarn Weight            | Recommended Hook Size (mm) | Gauge (Stitches x Rows per 4")              |
|-----------------------|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Lace / Fingering**   | 1.6 – 2.25 mm              | 24 – 32 sts, 32 – 40 rows                   |

| **Super Bulky**        | 9 – 12 mm                  | 10 – 12 sts, 12 – 16 rows                    |
| **Jumbo / Roving**     | 12 mm and up               | 6 – 10 sts, 10 – 14 rows                     |


## Example swatch chart

| Gauge           | Stitches (per 4") | Rows (per 4") | Hook Size (mm) | Yarn Weight      |
|-----------------|-------------------|---------------|----------------|------------------|
| Pattern gauge   | 16                | 20            | 5.0            | DK (Light)       |
| Your swatch     | 18                | 22            | 5.0            | DK (Light)       |
| Result          | Too tight         | Too many `sts`  | Try larger hook |                  |


## Quick gauge troubleshooting

| Problem                | Solution                     |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Too many stitches      | Use bigger hook              |
| Too few stitches       | Use smaller hook             |
| Rows too tall or short | Adjust tension or hook size  |
| Inconsistent tension   | Practice and relax hands     |
