title: Blocking
description: Defining blocking in crochet
---
Blocking in crochet is the process of shaping and setting your finished piece to its intended size and drape. It is useful for:
- Evening out stitches
- Flattening edges or lacework
- Opening up textures (like cables or lace)
- Giving the piece a professional finish

## Types of blocking

### Wet Blocking
```plaintext
- Check the yarn for pressing or special instructions
- Soak the piece in water (or gently wash)  
- Gently squeeze out excess water (do not wring)
- Pin it to a blocking mat in the desired shape and measurements 
- Let it air dry completely  
```

Best for natural fibers like wool, alpaca, and cotton  

### Steam Blocking
```plaintext
- Check the yarn for pressing or special instructions
- Pin the item in shape on a blocking mat in the desired shape and measurements
- Hover a steam iron or garment steamer just above the surface (do not press directly)  
- Lightly steam the piece and let it dry  
```

Great for acrylics and blends. Softens without melting the yarn  

### Spray Blocking
```plaintext
- Check the yarn for pressing or special instructions
- Pin the dry item in place  
- Mist lightly with water from a spray bottle  
- Let it dry completely  
```
Ideal for lightweight fabrics or gentle adjustments  

## When Should You Block?

- Before seaming pieces together (like in sweaters or motif blankets)  
- After finishing a scarf, shawl, or lace project  
- When edges curl or the stitch pattern needs to open up  

## Does Every Project Need Blocking?

Not always. Some projects — like dishcloths, toys (amigurumi), or very dense fabrics — may not require blocking at all.

## Blocking Tools

- Blocking mats (foam boards or towels)  
- Rust-proof pins or blocking wires  
- Spray bottle or garment steamer  
- Tape measure or ruler (for sizing)
