Swatching is an important step in crochet that helps ensure your finished project will have the right size and fabric feel.

## What is a swatch?

A **swatch** is a small sample of crochet fabric made using the yarn, hook, and pattern stitches you plan to use for your project. It allows you to:

- Check your **gauge** (stitch and row count per inch/cm).
- Test your **tension** and hook size.
- See how the yarn and stitch pattern work together.
- Decide if you need to adjust hook size or yarn choice.

## Why swatch?

- To make sure your finished item matches the pattern dimensions.
- To avoid surprises with size — no one wants a sweater that’s too small or too big!
- To get familiar with the stitch pattern.
- To check how the fabric drapes and feels.

## How to make a crochet swatch

1. **Choose your yarn and hook** as recommended in the pattern or your preference.
2. **Chain enough stitches** to make a square at least 4 inches (10 cm) wide, preferably more (5 inches or 12 cm is even better).
3. **Work the stitch pattern** for at least 4 inches (10 cm) in height.
4. Aim for a swatch larger than 4x4 inches if possible—this gives more accurate measurements.

## Measuring gauge

- Use a ruler or gauge tool to count how many stitches and rows fit into a 4-inch (10 cm) square.
- Count the stitches **across the width** (horizontal).
- Count the rows **down the length** (vertical).

## Adjusting your gauge

- If you have **too many stitches** per inch (swatch is too small/tight):
  - Try a **larger hook** for looser stitches.
- If you have **too few stitches** per inch (swatch is too large/loose):
  - Try a **smaller hook** for tighter stitches.

## Tips for swatching

- Use the **same yarn and hook** you plan for your project.
- Work your swatch in the **same stitch pattern** as your project.
- Relax your hands while crocheting for consistent tension.
- Wash and block your swatch if your project will be washed or blocked.
- Keep your swatch until your project is complete—it’s a handy reference!

## What if you don’t swatch?

- Your project size may be off.
- Garments might not fit well.
- Patterns may look different than expected.
