description: Voice and tone for crochet patterns

In crochet writing—such as patterns, tutorials, or blog posts—**voice** and **tone** shape how your content feels to the reader.

### Voice in Crochet

**Voice** is your consistent writing personality. It reflects your brand or personal style across all your content.

#### Examples of Different Voices

- **Conversational and friendly**:  
  “Let’s start by chaining 20 stitches.”

- **Precise and instructional**:  
  “Ch 20.”

- **Playful and warm**:  
  “Grab your hook and get cozy—we’re about to stitch some magic!”

Your voice should stay consistent whether you're writing a pattern, social media post, or newsletter.

### Tone in Crochet

**Tone** adapts to the context. It’s how you express your voice depending on the situation or audience.

#### Examples of Tone Changes

- **Encouraging** for beginners:  
  “Don’t worry if your edges aren’t perfect—just keep stitching!”

- **Excited** when launching a new pattern:  
  “I’m thrilled to share my latest mosaic design!”_

- **Calm and clear** when explaining complex steps:  
  “Take your time with this row—it may look tricky, but you’ve got this.”

### Summary

- **Voice** = Your consistent personality  
- **Tone** = The expression of your voice in a specific context
- Use plain language. Be clear, direct, and concise in patterns.
- Be encouraging. Avoid overly technical jargon unless it’s standard in crochet.
- Be inclusive. Avoid gendered language; refer to “maker” or “crocheter” rather than “he/she.”
