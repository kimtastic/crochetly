Crochet stitch instructions are the step-by-step directions for creating different crochet stitches. They guide the crocheter on how to manipulate the yarn and hook to form loops, yarn overs, and pulls through, resulting in the desired stitch pattern. These instructions are fundamental to understanding and creating various crochet projects. 

### Formatting stitch instructions

- Use a numbered list for row/round instructions.
- Use parentheses for groups and asterisks for repeats.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Ch 20.
Row 1: Sc in 2nd ch from hook and in each ch across. Turn. (19 sc)
Row 2: Ch 1, sc in next 3 sts, inc in next st; repeat from * to end. Turn.
```
