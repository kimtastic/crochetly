In crochet, formatting a pattern means presenting the instructions in a clear, organized, and standardized way so that other crocheters can easily understand and follow them to create the same finished item. 

Key elements of a well-formatted crochet pattern:

### Intro
A brief description of the pattern and what the finished object will be.

### Pattern Title
- Use Title Case (e.g., “Sunrise Mosaic Shawl”).
- Keep it descriptive and memorable.

### Difficulty level
Indicating the skill level required to complete the pattern.

### Materials list
A detailed list of all necessary items, including yarn specifications (type, weight, color, yardage), hook size, and any other notions.

### Gauge 
The stitch and row count within a specific measurement, crucial for achieving the correct size.

### Pattern sizes
For patterns that come in multiple sizes, clearly outlining the dimensions for each size variation.

### Stitches and abbreviations
Providing a clear list of all stitches used in the pattern along with their abbreviations, adhering to industry standards like those of the Craft Yarn Council.

### Notes 
Including important information or tips for working the pattern.

### Written pattern
The step-by-step instructions for creating the project, usually organized by row or round.

### Photos and visuals
Including clear images of the finished project and potentially progress photos or diagrams to illustrate techniques.

### Copyright information 
Stating how the pattern can and cannot be used.
