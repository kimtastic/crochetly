description: Repeats and sizing for crochet patterns
---
In crochet, creating content that make repeats and sizing clear is crucial for makers to successfully follow patterns and create projects that turn out as intended. 

### Repeats
Repeats refer to sections of instructions in a crochet pattern that are repeated multiple times.
- Simplify pattern writing, making the instructions shorter and easier to follow. 
- Repeats allow for faster reading.
- Use asterisks (*) and brackets consistently.

### Stitch repeats
These involve repeating a sequence of stitches within a single row or round. 

For example, [`sc` in next `st`, `ch 1`] 5 times means you'll work "`sc` in next `st`, `ch 1`" five times in a row.

### Row/Round repeats
This means repeating an entire row or round of crochet instructions.
How they are indicated: Repeats are often indicated using punctuation like asterisks (*), parentheses (()), or brackets ([]). 
- Use asterisks (*) and brackets consistently.

## Sizing
Sizing in crochet refers to the final dimensions and fit of your finished project. This is especially important for wearable items like garments, where the piece needs to fit a specific person.
- Clarify which instructions apply to which size.
- For multiple sizes, list stitch counts in parentheses.

## Why it matters
Sizing ensures your project will fit as intended. If your finished piece is too small or too large, it may not be wearable or useful.

## Checking your size
Gauge is the number of stitches and rows per a certain measurement (usually 4 inches or 10 cm). It's crucial for achieving the correct size. You'll make a gauge swatch, measure it, and compare it to the pattern's gauge.

## Finished measurements
Patterns typically provide the final dimensions of the completed project, such as width, length, and circumference.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Ch 72 (84, 96) for S (M, L) sizes.
