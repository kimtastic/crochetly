Gauge refers to the number of stitches and rows you make per inch or 4 inches, usually measured in a swatch. Tension is the term more commonly used in the UK. See [gauge and tension](gauge-and-tension.md) for more information.

- State both swatch dimensions and stitch counts.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Gauge: 14 ``sts x 16 rows = 4" x 4" in dc
```
