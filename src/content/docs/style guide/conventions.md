description: Measurement conventions for crochet patterns
---
Crochet patterns follow established conventions to ensure clarity and consistency. These conventions include using standard abbreviations for stitches (like `sc` for single crochet and `dc` for double crochet), structuring instructions row by row or round by round, and employing symbols in diagrams. 

Additionally, patterns typically specify yarn type and weight, gauge, and any special techniques used. 

**Tips**
- Be consistent in your use of numbers. Use numerals for numbers. 
- Use inches and centimeters (US-first, metric in parentheses).
- Use a space between numbers and units.
