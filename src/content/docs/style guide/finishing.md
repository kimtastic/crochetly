**Finishing** refers to the final steps taken to secure the end of a project and prepare it for use or display. This typically involves fastening off (disconnecting the yarn from the project and securing the yarn tail) and weaving in ends (hiding the yarn tails within the stitches)

- Be specific. Use action-oriented verbs like “Weave in ends,” or “Block to dimensions.”
- Include a blocking recommendation if needed.
