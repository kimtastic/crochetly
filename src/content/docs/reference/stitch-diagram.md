description: Defining a stitch diagram in crochet

A stitch diagram represents the right side of the work. 

## How to Read a Crochet Diagram

- Diagrams are typically read **from the center outward** (for motifs) or **bottom to top**, **right to left** (for rows)
- Each **symbol represents a stitch**. A legend or key is always provided
- For **flat pieces**, odd rows are read right to left, even rows left to right
- For **rounds**, work counter-clockwise unless noted otherwise


## Why Use Stitch Diagrams?

- They’re **universal**: no need to translate text from one language to another
- They help you **visualize complex patterns** like lace or motifs
- They’re often **more accurate** than long written instructions for positioning stitches
