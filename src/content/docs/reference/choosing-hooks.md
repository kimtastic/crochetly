title: Choosing hooks
description: A guide to choosing hooks for a crochet project
---
Choosing and understanding your crochet hooks is key to creating beautiful projects. Here's what you need to know:

## Choosing the right hook

- Follow the yarn label recommendation (usually listed in mm).
- Use the hook size suggested in your pattern for correct gauge.
- Adjust hook size to change fabric tension (larger hook = looser fabric).

## Hook sizes

Crochet hooks come in various sizes, affecting the size of your stitches and overall fabric.
- Metric sizes (mm) refer to the diameter of the hook shaft.
- Larger diameter = bigger stitches, looser fabric.
- Smaller diameter = tighter stitches, denser fabric.

| Size System       | Size Range            | Typical Uses                      |
|-------------------|----------------------|---------------------------------|
| **US Sizes**      | B (2.25 mm) to S (19 mm) | Smaller hooks for fine yarns to large hooks for bulky yarns |
| **Metric Sizes**  | 2 mm to 25 mm        | Precise measurement in millimeters |
| **UK Sizes**      | 14 (small) to 000 (large) | Different naming, less common globally |

**Beginners:** Use a **5.0 mm (H-8)** hook with **worsted weight yarn**.

## Hook materials

| Material     | Characteristics                                   |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Aluminum** | Lightweight, smooth, good for most yarn types    |
| **Steel**    | Very small hooks for lace and fine thread crochet|
| **Plastic**  | Lightweight, sometimes less smooth, budget-friendly|
| **Wood/Bamboo**| Warm, slightly textured grip, slows down stitching—good for slippery yarns |

Choose a hook that feels comfortable in your hand and doesn’t tire your wrist.

## Hook anatomy

| Part           | Description                          |
|----------------|------------------------------------|
| **Head**       | The rounded tip that inserts into stitches |
| **Throat/Gorge**| The narrow part that pulls yarn through loops |
| **Shaft**      | The straight part where loops form  |
| **Handle/Grip**| The part you hold (varies in shape/material) |

## Special hooks

- **Ergonomic hooks:** Designed for comfort with cushioned grips.
- **Tunisian hooks:** Longer hooks or double-ended hooks for Tunisian crochet.
- **Crochet hooks with built-in light:** For working in low light.

## Tips for beginners

- Start with a medium size hook (5 mm/H-8) and medium weight yarn.
- Try different materials to see what feels best in your hand.
- Keep your hook clean and free of burrs for smooth stitching.

## Matching yarn and hook

Always check the **recommended hook size** on the yarn label for best results.

- Larger hook → looser fabric and more drape.
- Smaller hook → tighter, firmer fabric.

## Swatching and gauge

Before starting a project (especially wearables), make a **gauge swatch** to ensure your stitches match the pattern. See [Gauge and Tension](gauge-and-tension.md) for more information.
