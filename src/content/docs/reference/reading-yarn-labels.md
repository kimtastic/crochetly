description: A guide to reading a yarn label
---
Yarn labels provide essential information for your crochet projects. Knowing how to read them helps you pick the right yarn and understand how to care for your finished work. Look for this key info on the yarn label:

- **Weight category** (e.g., 4 - Worsted)
- **Recommended hook size**
- **Gauge** (e.g., 16 stitches x 20 rows = 4")
- **Yardage** (meters/yards per skein)
- **Care instructions**

The following information takes a closer look at all information you may find on a yarn label.

## Yarn brand & name

- The manufacturer’s name and the specific yarn line (e.g., *Lion Brand* “Vanna’s Choice”).
- Helpful for finding matching yarn later or looking up details online.

## Fiber content

- Lists the materials (e.g., 100% acrylic, 80% wool/20% nylon).
- Influences feel, warmth, durability, and care instructions.

## Yarn weight / category

- Indicates thickness, often shown as a number or category. See [choosing yarn](choosing-yarn.md) for more details.
- Helps you match yarn with your pattern’s requirements.

## Yardage / meterage

- Length of yarn in the skein (e.g., 220 yards / 200 meters).
- Important to know how much yarn you need for your project.

## Recommended hook / needle size

- Suggests crochet hook size (e.g., 5 mm / H-8).
- Following this helps you achieve the right gauge and fabric texture.


## Gauge information

- Shows how many stitches and rows you should get in a specific area (usually 4" x 4" or 10 x 10 cm).
- Example: 16 stitches and 20 rows = 4 inches with a 5 mm hook.
- Helps ensure your finished item matches the pattern size.

## Care instructions

- Washing and drying guidelines (symbols or text).
- Examples:
  - Machine washable or hand wash only
  - Dry flat or tumble dry low
  - Do not bleach

## Dye lot number

- Indicates a batch of yarn dyed together.
- Important to buy all yarn for one project from the same dye lot to avoid color differences.

## Other information

- Color name or number
- Fiber certifications (e.g., organic, fair trade)
