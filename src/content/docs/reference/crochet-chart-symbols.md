## Notes on symbol usage

- Symbols visually represent stitches in crochet charts.
- Directions (e.g., front/back post) often indicated by placement of lines/hooks around basic stitch symbol.
- Increases shown by V shapes; decreases by ∧ or diagonal connections.
- Special stitches (bobble, puff, popcorn) often use circles or filled shapes combined with small lines.
