Crochet is a relaxing and creative craft but sometimes you need to troubleshoot your project. This guide will help you with common challenges.

## General Crochet Tips

- **Tension too tight or loose:**  
  Adjust your hook size or consciously relax your hand to even out stitches.

- **Splitting yarn:**  
  Use a smoother yarn or a hook with a rounded tip. Slow down and watch your stitches carefully.

- **Skipping stitches:**  
  Count your stitches regularly to avoid accidentally missing or adding stitches.

- **Uneven edges:**  
  Make sure to chain the correct number of stitches at the beginning of rows and count your stitches.

- **Curling edges:**  
  Try blocking your finished piece or use a larger hook for looser stitches.

- **Confusing patterns:**  
  Use stitch markers and take notes.


## Amigurumi-Specific Tips

## Tips for Success

- Use a smaller hook than recommended for your yarn to create tight stitches so stuffing doesn’t show through.
- Keep your tension consistent.
- Use stitch markers to keep track of rounds.
- Don’t stuff too hard, or your toy might stretch.
- Practice makes perfect!

- **Holes between stitches:**  
  Use smaller hooks than recommended to create tight stitches that prevent stuffing from showing.

- **Lopsided shapes:**  
  Check increases and decreases carefully and count stitches each round.

- **Stuffing shows or lumps:**  
  Stuff firmly but not too much; use polyester fiberfill and smooth it evenly.

- **Safety eyes slipping:**  
  Secure with washers or embroider eyes for safety, especially for children’s toys.

- **Working in spirals without joining:**  
  Use a stitch marker to keep track of the beginning of each round.

## Tunisian Crochet Tips

- **Hard to pull loops over:**  
  Make sure your hook is smooth and use a yarn that glides easily.

- **Rows curling or fabric stiff:**  
  Try blocking your project; also, experiment with hook size or yarn weight.

- **Losing loops off the hook:**  
  Keep a firm grip on the hook and consider using a hook with a stopper or a clip.

- **Counting stitches on the forward pass:**  
  Use stitch markers or place a marker every 10 stitches to keep track.

- **Tension inconsistent between forward and return pass:**  
  Practice keeping even tension on both passes for uniform fabric.


## Bonus Tips

- **Use stitch markers liberally** to keep track of your place.
- **Count stitches often** to catch mistakes early.
- **Watch tutorials or ask for help** in crochet communities.
- **Take breaks** if your hands get tired to avoid mistakes from fatigue.
- **Practice patience!** Mistakes are part of learning.
