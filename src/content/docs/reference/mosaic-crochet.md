**Mosaic crochet** is a colorwork technique that uses basic stitches (usually single and double crochet) to create intricate, geometric patterns. The results look complex but the technique is beginner-friendly and typically worked with one color per row.

## What is Mosaic Crochet?

Mosaic crochet creates colorful motifs using simple stitches and a chart or written instructions. It’s typically:
- Worked in **rows** (overlay mosaic) or **rounds** (inset mosaic)
- Done using **only one color at a time**
- Made using **chains, single crochet (sc), and double crochet (dc)**

## Two Main Techniques

### Overlay Mosaic Crochet
- **Worked in rows**, with each row using just one color
- Use **single crochet** in back loop only (BLO) for most stitches
- Drop **double crochet (dc)** stitches down to cover stitches in earlier rows
- Each row is typically **not turned**; instead, cut the yarn or carry up the side

### Inset Mosaic Crochet
- **Worked into spaces**, often from a chart or graph
- Uses chains and **dc stitches into skipped stitches from previous rows**
- Typically **turned every row**, similar to regular crochet
- Less texture than overlay


## Basic Stitches Used

| Stitch Abbreviation | Name                   | Usage in Mosaic Crochet                  |
|---------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `sc`                | Single Crochet         | Fills stitches, especially in the current row |
| `dc`                | Double Crochet         | Worked into rows below to create the mosaic pattern |
| `blo`               | Back Loop Only         | Used with sc to create overlay texture   |
| `ch`                | Chain                  | Skips spaces or forms foundation rows     |
| `mc`                | Main Color             | The background or dominant color         |
| `cc`                | Contrast Color         | The pattern or accent color              |


## Tools You’ll Need

- 2 or more contrasting yarn colors
- Crochet hook appropriate for yarn weight
- Scissors
- Tapestry needle (for weaving ends)
- Stitch markers (optional)

## How to Read Mosaic Crochet Charts

- Each **square = one stitch**
- Colors in the chart indicate which color to use
- Often worked **right to left**, bottom to top
- **X, filled squares, or symbols** show where to place dropped dc stitches
- Legend and row instructions often included

## Sample Overlay Mosaic Row (Overlay Style)

Written row example (assuming you're using Color A):

```plaintext
Row 1 (Color A): sc across (BLO)
Row 2 (Color B): sc in blo of each sc, dc in skipped st 2 rows below as marked
```
