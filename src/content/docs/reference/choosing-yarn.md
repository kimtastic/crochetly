## Yarn weight (thickness)

Yarn weight refers to how thick or thin the yarn is. It affects the size and texture of your project.

**Beginners:** Start with **Worsted (Category 4)** or **DK (Category 3)** for better stitch visibility and control.

## Fiber content

The material the yarn is made from influences feel, durability, and care. Different fibers affect stretch, softness, warmth, and ease of use:

- **Natural fibers:** Wool, cotton, alpaca, silk (soft, breathable, often pricier)
- **Synthetic fibers:** Acrylic, nylon, polyester (affordable, durable, easy care)
- **Blends:** Combine best features of natural and synthetic fibers


| Fiber Type     | Characteristics                              |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Acrylic        | Budget-friendly, washable, great for practice |
| Cotton         | Sturdy, breathable, ideal for dishcloths or bags |
| Wool           | Warm and stretchy, great for wearables        |
| Bamboo         | Soft and silky, drapes beautifully            |
| Blends         | Combines properties of multiple fibers        |

**Beginners:** Start with **acrylic** or **cotton** yarns are great starting points because they are affordable, durable, and machine washable.

## Yarn ply

- Ply refers to the number of strands twisted together.
- More plies usually mean stronger, smoother yarn.
- Single-ply yarn is softer but may split easily.


## Yardage / meterage

# Yarn Weight Categories: Length per 100 grams

| **Yarn Weight** | **Category Name**  | **Yardage (per 100g)** | **Meterage (per 100g)** |
|-----------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------|
| 0               | Lace               | 800–1200 yards         | 730–1100 meters         |
| 1               | Super Fine         | 400–600 yards          | 365–550 meters          |
| 2               | Fine               | 325–450 yards          | 300–410 meters          |
| 3               | Light              | 240–340 yards          | 220–310 meters          |
| 4               | Medium (Worsted)   | 180–240 yards          | 165–220 meters          |
| 5               | Bulky              | 100–140 yards          | 90–130 meters           |
| 6               | Super Bulky        | 60–100 yards           | 55–90 meters            |
| 7               | Jumbo              | <50 yards              | <45 meters              |

> **Notes:**  
- These values are approximate averages; actual yardage varies by fiber and brand.  
- Finer yarns have more length per 100g due to thinner strands.

- Always check the length of yarn per skein.
- Project requirements often list yarn in yards or meters.
- Longer yardage means fewer joins and ends to weave in.

## Color & dye lots

- Yarn color may vary slightly between dye lots.
- Buy enough yarn from the same dye lot to ensure color consistency.

## Texture

- Smooth yarns are easier for beginners.
- Textured yarns (bouclé, eyelash, chenille) add interest but can be tricky.

## Care instructions

- Check labels for washing and drying.
- Some yarns need hand washing; others are machine washable.

## Final tips

- For beginners, start with medium weight (worsted, category 4) acrylic or cotton yarn.
- Use the recommended hook size on the yarn label.
- Make a gauge swatch to match pattern requirements.
